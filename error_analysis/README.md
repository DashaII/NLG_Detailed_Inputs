Datasets for manual error evaluation.

1a and 1b are results of baseline and amr-enriched models for subset of dev dataset.

2a and 2b are results of baseline and amr-enriched models for a new dataset.

Baseline instances are the next items in both files:
IDX_1 = [0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 49]

Amr-enriched instances are the next items in both files:
IDX_2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 45, 46, 47, 48]
